# FHIR News

## What is it and why do we need it??

FHIR stands for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, a next-generation interoperability standard created by the standards development organization Health Level 7 (HL7). FHIR is designed to enable health data, including clinical and administrative data, to be quickly and efficiently exchanged.
It's a human readable health record that allows accessibility and interoperability between health record systems.

## Past Sprints

> **FHIRPower** [Click for more details](./FHIRPower)

We created custom connectors (usable in PowerAutomate, Flow and LogicApps) to connect to Microsoft's Azure API for FHIR. 

Developed a patient's and clinician's app using PowerApp. Using the custom connectors we were able to access the health records of (fake) patients and practitioners to create an Appointment between patients and doctors/practitioners.

We held a two day internal hackathon to learn more about how to leverage Azure's API for FHIR under different scenarios.
