# Genomics News

During the past few sprints our team put together a one-day hackathon focused on Genomics. Our customers have a lot of work to do to derive insights and information from the growing volume of sequencing data. Our goal is to get more people comfortable with what our customers are working on and the tools that we have for them to accomplish their goals.

### Why should you learn about genomics on Azure?
Genomics will play a central role in improving healthcare delivery for the foreseeable future. Some of the key areas include:
* Drug discovery. As we've seen with COVID-19 vaccines, understanding the viral genome has led to vaccines produced at remarkable pace.
* Precision medicine. By understanding both the disease as well as the patient's genome, pharma companies can produce more targeted therapies.
* Rare diseases. Some of the most devasting diseases can now be better understood using genetics which will lead to cures.

> What did participants learn?
* This hackathon introduced key concepts and terminology used in the industry.
* Some of the common workflows that our customers are using to derive insight from genomic information.
* Set up and configured Cromwell on Azure as well as Nextflow on Azure.
* Ran through a sample workflow using both technologies.
* Reviewed the output and how this can be used to empower downstream analytic processes.

> Hackathon Agenda

The hack will be broken down into two sections, a kickoff meeting and the workshop/hack.

> Kick-off

* We’ll cover the basics of genomics (DNA/RNA, Transcription, Translation etc.). If you’re are a beginner, checkout the quickstart and the video links that we sent out.
* We’ll introduce some of the more common workflows customers are asking about. We’ll focus on DNA-Seq, RNA-Seq but it’s possible your customers could be doing something else. The basics and the tools used will be similar.

> Hack
* You will break into teams and work on setting up Cromwell on Azure and Nextflow on Azure
* You will run a sample DNA-Seq pipeline on Cromwell and a RNA-Seq pipeline on Nextflow.
* Use this time to discuss with your team and share some of your customer experiences.
