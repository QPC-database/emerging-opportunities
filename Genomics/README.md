### What did participants learn?
1. This hackathon introduced key concepts and terminology used in the industry.
2. Some of the common workflows that our customers are using to derive insight from genomic information.
3. Set up and configured Cromwell on Azure as well as Nextflow on Azure.
4. Ran through a sample workflow using both technologies.
5. Reviewed the output and how this can be used to empower downstream analytic processes.

### Hackathon Agenda - 
The hack will be broken down into two sections, a kickoff meeting and the workshop/hack.

#### Kick-off

1. We’ll cover the basics of genomics (DNA/RNA, Transcription, Translation etc.). If you’re are a beginner, checkout the quickstart and the video links that we sent out.
2. We’ll introduce some of the more common workflows customers are asking about. We’ll focus on DNA-Seq, RNA-Seq but it’s possible your customers could be doing something else. The basics and the tools used will be similar.

#### Hack
1. You will break into teams and work on setting up Cromwell on Azure and Nextflow on Azure
2. You will run a sample DNA-Seq pipeline on Cromwell and a RNA-Seq pipeline on Nextflow.
3. Use this time to discuss with your team and share some of your customer experiences.
